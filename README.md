# java-bank-application

Java desktop application to manage bank accounts with a back office and a front office (all the layouts are made with Java Swing). Where admins can delete accounts, get all the informations about their customers, add funds to a bank account and check all the transactions.
While regular customers after signing in can transfer money to other accounts, retrieve money and check their transactions.
I've also used Nexmo API to send short messages to the customers phones.
This project was made for educational purposes only, it was a school project.
